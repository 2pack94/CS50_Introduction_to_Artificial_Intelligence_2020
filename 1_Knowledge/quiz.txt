Proof with Model Checking Algorithm:
Harry   Hermione    KB (Hermione)   Query (¬ Harry v Hermione)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
False   False       False           -
False   True        True            True
True    False       False           -
True    True        True            True
Proof by contradiction:
(Hermione) ∧ ¬ (¬ Harry v Hermione)     // check if (KB ∧ ¬query) is a contradiction
(Hermione) ∧ (Harry ∧ ¬ Hermione)       // De Morgan’s Law
Hermione ∧ ¬ Hermione ∧ Harry           // reorder
() ∧ Harry                              // resolve literal and its negation to an empty clause
