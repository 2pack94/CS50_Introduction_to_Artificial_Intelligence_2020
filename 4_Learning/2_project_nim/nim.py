# The game Nim begins with some number of piles, each with some number of objects.
# Players take turns: on a playerâ€™s turn, the player removes a number of objects from any one non-empty pile.
# Whoever removes the last object loses.

# The Reinforcement learning algorithm Q-learning will be trained on the game.
# The reward values are -1 for an action that looses the game, 1 for an action that wins the game and
# a value in between -1 and 1 (float) for an action that continues the game (consisting of current reward
# that is always 0 and future expected rewards).
# Function Q(s, a) outputs an estimate of the reward value (Q-value) of taking action a in state s.
# The state is represented by a list of numbers where each number is the current number of objects in a pile.
# An action is represented by the tuple (i, j), taking j objects from pile i.

# All Q-values are 0 initially. A Q-value exists for every (state, action) pair.
# Only when the game is over the Q-value of the current and previous (state, action) gets updated.
# When in the next game a state next to this previous state is reached, the Q-value of this state
# also gets updated, because it sees the future rewards from the state (used in the Q-learning formula).
# In this way the Q-value update propagates back to the start state.
