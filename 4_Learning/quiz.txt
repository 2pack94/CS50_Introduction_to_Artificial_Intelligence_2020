    Unsupervised learning
    Not an example of machine learning
    Reinforcement learning
    Supervised learning
A: Supervised learning

Q: Imagine a regression AI that makes the following predictions for the following 5 data points.
What is the total L2 loss across all of these data points (i.e., the sum of all the individual L2 losses for each data point)?
For data point 1, the true output is 2 and the AI predicted 4.
For data point 2, the true output is 4 and the AI predicted 5.
For data point 3, the true output is 4 and the AI predicted 3.
For data point 4, the true output is 5 and the AI predicted 2.
For data point 5, the true output is 6 and the AI predicted 5.
A: (2 - 4)² + (4 - 5)² + (4 - 3)² + (5 - 2)² + (6 - 5)² = 16

Q: If Hypothesis 1 has a lower L1 loss and a lower L2 loss than Hypothesis 2 on a set of training data,
why might Hypothesis 2 still be a preferable hypothesis?
    Hypothesis 1 might be the result of regularization.
    Hypothesis 1 might be the result of overfitting.
    Hypothesis 1 might be the result of regression.
    Hypothesis 1 might be the result of cross-validation.
    Hypothesis 1 might be the result of loss.
A: Hypothesis 1 might be the result of overfitting.

Q: In the ε-greedy approach to action selection in reinforcement learning,
which of the following values of ε makes the approach identical to a purely greedy approach?
A: ε = 0
