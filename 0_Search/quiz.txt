Q: Between depth first search (DFS) and breadth first search (BFS), which will find a shorter path through a maze?
A: BFS will sometimes, but not always, find a shorter path than DFS
(BFS will find a path that is shorter or equal compared to DFS)

Q: ... which one (or multiple, if multiple are possible) could be the algorithm used?
A: Could only be DFS

Q: Why is depth-limited minimax sometimes preferable to minimax without a depth limit?
A: Depth-limited minimax can arrive at a decision more quickly because it explores fewer states

Q: ... What is the value of the root node?
A: 5
