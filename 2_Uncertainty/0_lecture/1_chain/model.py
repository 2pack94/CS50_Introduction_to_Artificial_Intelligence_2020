# Markov assumption: The current state depends on only a finite fixed number of previous states.
# A Markov chain is a sequence of events in which the probability of each event
# depends only on the previous event.

# Define starting probabilities
start = DiscreteDistribution({
    "sun": 0.5,
    "rain": 0.5
})

# Define transition model
transitions = ConditionalProbabilityTable([
    ["sun", "sun", 0.8],
    ["sun", "rain", 0.2],
    ["rain", "sun", 0.3],
    ["rain", "rain", 0.7]

# Create Markov chain
