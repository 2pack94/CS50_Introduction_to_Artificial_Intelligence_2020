# Problem:
# Solve a Crossword Puzzle given its structure (defined in a structure file)
# and a list of available words (defined in a words file).

# The problem can be modeled as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).
# Each sequence of cells is one variable. The Domain of each variable is a list of
# possible words (values) that can be filled in that cell sequence.
# The unary constraint on a variable is given by its length.
# The binary constraints on a variable are given by its overlap with neighboring variables.
# Neighboring variables share a single cell that is common to them both.
# An overlap is represented with the tuple (i, j), where v1's ith character overlaps v2's jth character.
# Another binary constraint is that two variables cannot have the same value.

# The problem will be solved by using backtracking search with inference (Maintaining Arc-Consistency).
# Before starting the backtracking search, Node- and Arc-Consistency will be enforced.
# Variables will be selected primarily after the Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic
# and secondarily after the Degree heuristic.
# Values will be selected after the Least-Constraining Values heuristic.
